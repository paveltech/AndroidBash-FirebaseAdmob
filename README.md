Admob is the #1 mobile advertising platform to grow your app business and is powered by Googleâ€™s ad technology. You can integrate AdMob in your android application and start earning right away. The best way to use AdMob is with Firebase, though Google Mobile Ads SDK remains available as a standalone SDK which can also be used to integrate Admob with your android application. Admob publishers can start taking advantage of Firebase's free and unlimited analytics solution to monetize more intelligently, just by linking with Firebase and importing the Firebase SDK into your android application. In this tutorial we will be showing how to integrate Admob with your android application using Firebase.  Now let us create an android application on which we can integrate Firebase Admob to display Banner ads, Interstitial ads and Native Ads. 
1. We will display a Banner ad at the bottom of the activity. 
2. We will display an Interstitial ad covering the whole screen, once the user clicks on an item in the list of movies. 
3. We will display Native ads in between the list of movies displayed in a RecyclerView.
